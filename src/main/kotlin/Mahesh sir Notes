kotlin

-2017 - Google IO announced
-given by jetbrains
- Kotlin is a modern PL
-so many features
-null safety



in order to learn any OOPL

1. Class
2. Data
3. Object
4. Behaviour

Variables:  -Mutable :: var keywords
            -Immutable :: val keywords
            EG1 :: in Naresh IT

            EG2 :: Taking input from user
               readLine() -> this alone will show warning :: that there is a chance of getting a null pointer
               exception here.
               Inorder to fix it, will declare readLine()!! :: It means that (!!, called as assert not null operator)
               we are telling, NOO the method is initialized
               these all are features :)

            EG3 :: Data type declaration of specific type

            EG4 :: Assigning value with null, and later will assigned it

============================Function In Kotlin==============================================

- Sum fun we are creating --> Demonstration of funtions in Kotlin :: EG5

- Eg of interoperability, create one java class and call kotlin code in it.

Test.kt
=======

fun main(args:Array<String>)
{
    println(MyTest().todayInfo())
}

MyTest.java
===========

public class MyTest{

    public String todayInfo()
    {

    }

}

- The 90% syntax of kotlin and swift are same.

function declaration in kotlin

fun displayTodayInfo():String
{
    var msg = "Today is : 21-july-2018"
    return msg
}

function declaration in swift

func displayTodayInfo()->String
{
    var msg = "Today is : 21-july-2018"
    return msg
}

===============================Constructors=================================================
usage:: its is used to initialize instance variables at the time of object creation

Constructors in Kotlin
    1. Primary Constructors
    2. Secondary Constructors
